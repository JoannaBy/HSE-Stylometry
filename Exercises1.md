## Basic stylo corpus exploration exercises

### Produce 10 cluster analyses for 100 up to 1000 most frequent words. Save the pictures and take a closer look at the results. Think:
* Are the graphs similar in any way?  
* Which texts change their position? Can you explain what could influence that?  

### Check your wordlist and frequencies files. Think:
* What kind of words appear on top of the list? What is surprising?  
* Do the results suggest using *culling* may help balance the scores?  

### Use different a few distance measures for your analysis of choice (keeping other parameters the same). Think:
* Are the results stable? Do they seem method-independent?  

### Produce a bootstrap consensus tree. Think:
* Do you remember why you need at least three iterations?  
* Is the positioning of texts very different from what you get in cluster analysis?  

### Create your own network in Gephi. Check if you can:
* Load the data accordingly.   
* Layout your nodes so as to read it clearly.  
* Add labels to your nodes and make them appear on the graph. If your network is big do you remember how to align the labels? 
* Use *Modularity* algorithm to look at communities invisible to your eyes.  

### Can you see in your data two groups that may differ in an interesting way? Perhaps there seems to be a division between texts published earlier or later, authors from North and South, or men and women? Practise your 'oppose' skills. Check if you can:  
* Divide your corpus into two sets,  
* Create a graph presenting words characteristic to each of the groups,  
* Create a graph using markings to visualize relations between the groups.  
Think:  
* What do preferred and avoided words reveal about each of the groups? Does it seem significant?  
* Can you really see the separation between two groups you consider? Or maybe you notice some other division?
